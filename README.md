Eli Bendersky's ESMS Software (https://github.com/eliben/esms) is a soccer management simulator used to run play-by-email soccer leagues. A play-by-email (PBEM) soccer league consists of an administrator, who runs the league, and managers, each managing one or more teams in the league.

Java Electronic Soccer Management Simulator
JEsMS is a porting/enhancement of ESMS for the Java language. While the algorithms running game logic are still the same used in ESMS (and therefore it's a porting) i tried to enhance classic ESMS using all advantages that Java has on C/C++ for this kind of programs (since the first time i saw ESMS i was sure that it was perfect for a Java implementation).
